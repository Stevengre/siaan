# Symphony Service Specification

Status: Draft v1 (language-agnostic)

Purpose: Define a service that orchestrates coding agents to get project work done.

## 1. Problem Statement

Symphony is a long-running automation service that continuously reads work from an issue tracker
(Linear in this specification version), creates an isolated workspace for each issue, and runs a
coding agent session for that issue inside the workspace.

The service solves four operational problems:

- It turns issue execution into a repeatable daemon workflow instead of manual scripts.
- It isolates agent execution in per-issue workspaces so agent commands run only inside per-issue
  workspace directories.
- It keeps the workflow policy in-repo (`WORKFLOW.md`) so teams version the agent prompt and runtime
  settings with their code.
- It provides enough observability to operate and debug multiple concurrent agent runs.

Implementations are expected to document their trust and safety posture explicitly. This
specification does not require a single approval, sandbox, or operator-confirmation policy; some
implementations may target trusted environments with a high-trust configuration, while others may
require stricter approvals or sandboxing.

Important boundary:

- Symphony is a scheduler/runner and tracker reader.
- Ticket writes (state transitions, comments, PR links) are typically performed by the coding agent
  using tools available in the workflow/runtime environment.
- A successful run may end at a workflow-defined handoff state (for example `Human Review`), not
  necessarily `Done`.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

- Poll the issue tracker on a fixed cadence and dispatch work with bounded concurrency.
- Maintain a single authoritative orchestrator state for dispatch, retries, and reconciliation.
- Create deterministic per-issue workspaces and preserve them across runs.
- Stop active runs when issue state changes make them ineligible.
- Recover from transient failures with exponential backoff.
- Load runtime behavior from a repository-owned `WORKFLOW.md` contract.
- Expose operator-visible observability (at minimum structured logs).
- Support restart recovery without requiring a persistent database.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- Rich web UI or multi-tenant control plane.
- Prescribing a specific dashboard or terminal UI implementation.
- General-purpose workflow engine or distributed job scheduler.
- Built-in business logic for how to edit tickets, PRs, or comments. (That logic lives in the
  workflow prompt and agent tooling.)
- Mandating strong sandbox controls beyond what the coding agent and host OS provide.
- Mandating a single default approval, sandbox, or operator-confirmation posture for all
  implementations.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Main Components

1. `Workflow Loader`
   - Reads `WORKFLOW.md`.
   - Parses YAML front matter and prompt body.
   - Returns `{config, prompt_template}`.

2. `Config Layer`
   - Exposes typed getters for workflow config values.
   - Applies defaults and environment variable indirection.
   - Performs validation used by the orchestrator before dispatch.

3. `Issue Tracker Client`
   - Fetches candidate issues in active states.
   - Fetches current states for specific issue IDs (reconciliation).
   - Fetches terminal-state issues during startup cleanup.
   - Normalizes tracker payloads into a stable issue model.

4. `Orchestrator`
   - Owns the poll tick.
   - Owns the in-memory runtime state.
   - Decides which issues to dispatch, retry, stop, or release.
   - Tracks session metrics and retry queue state.

5. `Workspace Manager`
   - Maps issue identifiers to workspace paths.
   - Ensures per-issue workspace directories exist.
   - Runs workspace lifecycle hooks.
   - Cleans workspaces for terminal issues.

6. `Agent Runner`
   - Creates workspace.
   - Builds prompt from issue + workflow template.
   - Launches the coding agent app-server client.
   - Streams agent updates back to the orchestrator.

7. `Status Surface` (optional)
   - Presents human-readable runtime status (for example terminal output, dashboard, or other
     operator-facing view).

8. `Logging`
   - Emits structured runtime logs to one or more configured sinks.

9. `Repository Install Task`
   - Provides `mix siaan.install` as the bootstrap and convergence entry point for GitHub-backed
     repos.
   - Maintains lifecycle labels, `.github/siaan-security.yml`, repository guardrails, and
     default-branch protection in a single idempotent flow.

### 3.2 Abstraction Levels

Symphony is easiest to port when kept in these layers:

1. `Policy Layer` (repo-defined)
   - `WORKFLOW.md` prompt body.
   - Team-specific rules for ticket handling, validation, and handoff.

2. `Configuration Layer` (typed getters)
   - Parses front matter into typed runtime settings.
   - Handles defaults, environment tokens, and path normalization.

3. `Coordination Layer` (orchestrator)
   - Polling loop, issue eligibility, concurrency, retries, reconciliation.

4. `Execution Layer` (workspace + agent subprocess)
   - Filesystem lifecycle, workspace preparation, coding-agent protocol.

5. `Integration Layer` (Linear adapter)
   - API calls and normalization for tracker data.

6. `Observability Layer` (logs + optional status surface)
   - Operator visibility into orchestrator and agent behavior.

### 3.3 External Dependencies

- Issue tracker API (Linear for `tracker.kind: linear` in this specification version).
- Local filesystem for workspaces and logs.
- Optional workspace population tooling (for example Git CLI, if used).
- Coding-agent executable that supports JSON-RPC-like app-server mode over stdio.
- Host environment authentication for the issue tracker and coding agent.

## 4. Core Domain Model

### 4.1 Entities

#### 4.1.1 Issue

Normalized issue record used by orchestration, prompt rendering, and observability output.

Fields:

- `id` (string)
  - Stable tracker-internal ID.
- `identifier` (string)
  - Human-readable ticket key (example: `ABC-123`).
- `title` (string)
- `description` (string or null)
- `priority` (integer or null)
  - Lower numbers are higher priority in dispatch sorting.
- `state` (string)
  - Current tracker state name.
- `branch_name` (string or null)
  - Tracker-provided branch metadata if available.
- `url` (string or null)
- `labels` (list of strings)
  - Normalized to lowercase.
- `blocked_by` (list of blocker refs)
  - Each blocker ref contains:
    - `id` (string or null)
    - `identifier` (string or null)
    - `state` (string or null)
- `created_at` (timestamp or null)
- `updated_at` (timestamp or null)

#### 4.1.2 Workflow Definition

Parsed `WORKFLOW.md` payload:

- `config` (map)
  - YAML front matter root object.
- `prompt_template` (string)
  - Markdown body after front matter, trimmed.

#### 4.1.3 Service Config (Typed View)

Typed runtime values derived from `WorkflowDefinition.config` plus environment resolution.

Examples:

- poll interval

- active and terminal issue states
- concurrency limits
- coding-agent executable/args/timeouts
- workspace hooks

#### 4.1.4 Workspace

Filesystem workspace assigned to one issue identifier.

Fields (logical):

- `path` (workspace path; current runtime typically uses absolute paths, but relative roots are
  possible if configured without path separators)
- `workspace_key` (sanitized issue identifier)
- `created_now` (boolean, used to gate `after_create` hook)

#### 4.1.5 Run Attempt

One execution attempt for one issue.

Fields (logical):

- `issue_id`
- `issue_identifier`
- `attempt` (integer or null, `null` for first run, `>=1` for retries/continuation)
- `workspace_path`
- `started_at`
- `status`
- `error` (optional)

#### 4.1.6 Live Session (Agent Session Metadata)

State tracked while a coding-agent subprocess is running.

Fields:

- `session_id` (string, `<thread_id>-<turn_id>`)
- `thread_id` (string)
- `turn_id` (string)
- `codex_app_server_pid` (string or null)

- `issue_id`
- `identifier` (best-effort human ID for status surfaces/logs)
- `attempt` (integer, 1-based for retry queue)
- `due_at_ms` (monotonic clock timestamp)
- `timer_handle` (runtime-specific timer reference)
- `error` (string or null)

#### 4.1.8 Orchestrator Runtime State

Single authoritative in-memory state owned by the orchestrator.

Fields:

- `poll_interval_ms` (current effective poll interval)
- `max_concurrent_agents` (current effective global concurrency limit)
- `running` (map `issue_id -> running entry`)
- `claimed` (set of issue IDs reserved/running/retrying)
- `retry_attempts` (map `issue_id -> RetryEntry`)
- `completed` (set of issue IDs; bookkeeping only, not dispatch gating)
- `codex_totals` (aggregate tokens + runtime seconds)
- `codex_rate_limits` (latest rate-limit snapshot from agent events)

### 4.2 Stable Identifiers and Normalization Rules

- `Issue ID`
  - Use for tracker lookups and internal map keys.
- `Issue Identifier`
  - Use for human-readable logs and workspace naming.
- `Workspace Key`
  - Derive from `issue.identifier` by replacing any character not in `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` with `_`.
  - Use the sanitized value for the workspace directory name.
- `Normalized Issue State`
  - Compare states after `lowercase`.
- `Session ID`
  - Compose from coding-agent `thread_id` and `turn_id` as `<thread_id>-<turn_id>`.

## 5. Workflow Specification (Repository Contract)

### 5.1 File Discovery and Path Resolution

Workflow file path precedence:

1. Explicit application/runtime setting (set by CLI startup path).
2. Default: `WORKFLOW.md` in the current process working directory.

Loader behavior:

- If the file cannot be read, return `missing_workflow_file` error.
- The workflow file is expected to be repository-owned and version-controlled.

### 5.2 File Format

`WORKFLOW.md` is a Markdown file with optional YAML front matter.

Design note:

- `WORKFLOW.md` should be self-contained enough to describe and run different workflows (prompt,
  runtime settings, hooks, and tracker selection/config) without requiring out-of-band
  service-specific configuration.

Parsing rules:

- If file starts with `---`, parse lines until the next `---` as YAML front matter.
- Remaining lines become the prompt body.
- If front matter is absent, treat the entire file as prompt body and use an empty config map.
- YAML front matter must decode to a map/object; non-map YAML is an error.
- Prompt body is trimmed before use.

Returned workflow object:

- `config`: front matter root object (not nested under a `config` key).
- `prompt_template`: trimmed Markdown body.

### 5.3 Front Matter Schema

Top-level keys:

- `tracker`
- `polling`
- `workspace`
- `hooks`
- `agent`
- `codex`

Unknown keys should be ignored for forward compatibility.

Note:

- The workflow front matter is extensible. Optional extensions may define additional top-level keys
  (for example `server`) without changing the core schema above.
- Extensions should document their field schema, defaults, validation rules, and whether changes
  apply dynamically or require restart.
- Common extension: `server.port` (integer) enables the optional HTTP server described in Section
  13.7.

#### 5.3.1 `tracker` (object)

Fields:

- `kind` (string)
  - Required for dispatch.
  - Current supported value: `linear`
- `endpoint` (string)
  - Default for `tracker.kind == "linear"`: `https://api.linear.app/graphql`
- `api_key` (string)
  - May be a literal token or `$VAR_NAME`.
  - Canonical environment variable for `tracker.kind == "linear"`: `LINEAR_API_KEY`.
  - If `$VAR_NAME` resolves to an empty string, treat the key as missing.
- `project_slug` (string)
  - Required for dispatch when `tracker.kind == "linear"`.
- `active_states` (list of strings)
  - Default: `Todo`, `In Progress`
- `terminal_states` (list of strings)
  - Default: `Closed`, `Cancelled`, `Canceled`, `Duplicate`, `Done`

#### 5.3.2 `polling` (object)

Fields:

- `interval_ms` (integer or string integer)
  - Default: `30000`
  - Changes should be re-applied at runtime and affect future tick scheduling without restart.

#### 5.3.3 `workspace` (object)

Fields:

- `root` (path string or `$VAR`)
  - Default: `<system-temp>/symphony_workspaces`
  - `~` and strings containing path separators are expanded.
  - Bare strings without path separators are preserved as-is (relative roots are allowed but
    discouraged).

#### 5.3.4 `hooks` (object)

Fields:

- `after_create` (multiline shell script string, optional)
  - Runs only when a workspace directory is newly created.
  - Failure aborts workspace creation.
- `before_run` (multiline shell script string, optional)
  - Runs before each agent attempt after workspace preparation and before launching the coding
    agent.
  - Failure aborts the current attempt.
- `after_run` (multiline shell script string, optional)
  - Runs after each agent attempt (success, failure, timeout, or cancellation) once the workspace
    exists.
  - Failure is logged but ignored.
- `before_remove` (multiline shell script string, optional)
  - Runs before workspace deletion if the directory exists.
  - Failure is logged but ignored; cleanup still proceeds.
- `timeout_ms` (integer, optional)
  - Default: `60000`
  - Applies to all workspace hooks.
  - Non-positive values should be treated as invalid and fall back to the default.
  - Changes should be re-applied at runtime for future hook executions.

#### 5.3.5 `agent` (object)

Fields:

- `max_concurrent_agents` (integer or string integer)
  - Default: `10`
  - Changes should be re-applied at runtime and affect subsequent dispatch decisions.
- `max_retry_backoff_ms` (integer or string integer)
  - Default: `300000` (5 minutes)
  - Changes should be re-applied at runtime and affect future retry scheduling.
- `max_concurrent_agents_by_state` (map `state_name -> positive integer`)
  - Default: empty map.
  - State keys are normalized (`lowercase`) for lookup.
  - Invalid entries (non-positive or non-numeric) are ignored.

#### 5.3.6 `codex` (object)

Fields:

For Codex-owned config values such as `approval_policy`, `thread_sandbox`, and
`turn_sandbox_policy`, supported values are defined by the targeted Codex app-server version.
Implementors should treat them as pass-through Codex config values rather than relying on a
hand-maintained enum in this spec. To inspect the installed Codex schema, run
`codex app-server generate-json-schema --out <dir>` and inspect the relevant definitions referenced
by `v2/ThreadStartParams.json` and `v2/TurnStartParams.json`. Implementations may validate these
fields locally if they want stricter startup checks.

- `command` (string shell command)
  - Default: `codex app-server`
  - The runtime launches this command via `bash -lc` in the workspace directory.
  - The launched process must speak a compatible app-server protocol over stdio.
- `approval_policy` (Codex `AskForApproval` value)
  - Default: implementation-defined.
- `thread_sandbox` (Codex `SandboxMode` value)
  - Default: implementation-defined.
- `turn_sandbox_policy` (Codex `SandboxPolicy` value)
  - Default: implementation-defined.
- `turn_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `3600000` (1 hour)
- `read_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `5000`
- `stall_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `300000` (5 minutes)
  - If `<= 0`, stall detection is disabled.

### 5.4 Prompt Template Contract

The Markdown body of `WORKFLOW.md` is the per-issue prompt template.

Rendering requirements:

- Use a strict template engine (Liquid-compatible semantics are sufficient).
- Unknown variables must fail rendering.
- Unknown filters must fail rendering.

Template input variables:

- `issue` (object)
  - Includes all normalized issue fields, including labels and blockers.
- `attempt` (integer or null)
  - `null`/absent on first attempt.
  - Integer on retry or continuation run.

Fallback prompt behavior:

- If the workflow prompt body is empty, the runtime may use a minimal default prompt
  (`You are working on an issue from Linear.`).
- Workflow file read/parse failures are configuration/validation errors and should not silently fall
  back to a prompt.

### 5.5 Workflow Validation and Error Surface

Error classes:

- `missing_workflow_file`
- `workflow_parse_error`
- `workflow_front_matter_not_a_map`
- `template_parse_error` (during prompt rendering)
- `template_render_error` (unknown variable/filter, invalid interpolation)

Dispatch gating behavior:

- Workflow file read/YAML errors block new dispatches until fixed.
- Template errors fail only the affected run attempt.

## 6. Configuration Specification

### 6.1 Source Precedence and Resolution Semantics

Configuration precedence:

1. Workflow file path selection (runtime setting -> cwd default).
2. YAML front matter values.
3. Environment indirection via `$VAR_NAME` inside selected YAML values.
4. Built-in defaults.

Value coercion semantics:

- Path/command fields support:
  - `~` home expansion
  - `$VAR` expansion for env-backed path values
  - Apply expansion only to values intended to be local filesystem paths; do not rewrite URIs or
    arbitrary shell command strings.

### 6.2 Dynamic Reload Semantics

Dynamic reload is required:

- The software should watch `WORKFLOW.md` for changes.
- On change, it should re-read and re-apply workflow config and prompt template without restart.
- The software should attempt to adjust live behavior to the new config (for example polling
  cadence, concurrency limits, active/terminal states, codex settings, workspace paths/hooks, and
  prompt content for future runs).
- Reloaded config applies to future dispatch, retry scheduling, reconciliation decisions, hook
  execution, and agent launches.
- Implementations are not required to restart in-flight agent sessions automatically when config
  changes.
- Extensions that manage their own listeners/resources (for example an HTTP server port change) may
  require restart unless the implementation explicitly supports live rebind.
- Implementations should also re-validate/reload defensively during runtime operations (for example
  before dispatch) in case filesystem watch events are missed.
- Invalid reloads should not crash the service; keep operating with the last known good effective
  configuration and emit an operator-visible error.

### 6.3 Dispatch Preflight Validation

This validation is a scheduler preflight run before attempting to dispatch new work. It validates
the workflow/config needed to poll and launch workers, not a full audit of all possible workflow
behavior.

Startup validation:

- Validate configuration before starting the scheduling loop.
- If startup validation fails, fail startup and emit an operator-visible error.

Per-tick dispatch validation:

- Re-validate before each dispatch cycle.
- If validation fails, skip dispatch for that tick, keep reconciliation active, and emit an
  operator-visible error.

Validation checks:

- Workflow file can be loaded and parsed.
- `tracker.kind` is present and supported.
- `tracker.api_key` is present after `$` resolution.
- `tracker.project_slug` is present when required by the selected tracker kind.
- `codex.command` is present and non-empty.

### 6.4 Config Fields Summary (Cheat Sheet)

This section is intentionally redundant so a coding agent can implement the config layer quickly.

- `tracker.kind`: string, required, currently `linear`
- `tracker.endpoint`: string, default `https://api.linear.app/graphql` when `tracker.kind=linear`
- `tracker.api_key`: string or `$VAR`, canonical env `LINEAR_API_KEY` when `tracker.kind=linear`
- `tracker.project_slug`: string, required when `tracker.kind=linear`
- `tracker.active_states`: list of strings, default `["Todo", "In Progress"]`
- `tracker.terminal_states`: list of strings, default `["Closed", "Cancelled", "Canceled", "Duplicate", "Done"]`
- `polling.interval_ms`: integer, default `30000`
- `workspace.root`: path, default `<system-temp>/symphony_workspaces`
- `worker.ssh_hosts` (extension): list of SSH host strings, optional; when omitted, work runs
  locally
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` (extension): positive integer, optional; shared per-host
  cap applied across configured SSH hosts
- `hooks.after_create`: shell script or null
- `hooks.before_run`: shell script or null
- `hooks.after_run`: shell script or null
- `hooks.before_remove`: shell script or null

- `agent.max_turns`: integer, default `20`
- `agent.max_retry_backoff_ms`: integer, default `300000` (5m)
- `agent.max_concurrent_agents_by_state`: map of positive integers, default `{}`
- `codex.command`: shell command string, default `codex app-server`
- `codex.approval_policy`: Codex `AskForApproval` value, default implementation-defined
- `codex.thread_sandbox`: Codex `SandboxMode` value, default implementation-defined
- `codex.turn_sandbox_policy`: Codex `SandboxPolicy` value, default implementation-defined
- `codex.turn_timeout_ms`: integer, default `3600000`
- `codex.read_timeout_ms`: integer, default `5000`
- `codex.stall_timeout_ms`: integer, default `300000`
- `server.port` (extension): integer, optional; enables the optional HTTP server, `0` may be used
  for ephemeral local bind, and CLI `--port` overrides it

## 7. Orchestration State Machine

The orchestrator is the only component that mutates scheduling state. All worker outcomes are
reported back to it and converted into explicit state transitions.

### 7.1 Issue Orchestration States

This is not the same as tracker states (`Todo`, `In Progress`, etc.). This is the service's internal
claim state.

1. `Unclaimed`
   - Issue is not running and has no retry scheduled.

2. `Claimed`
   - Orchestrator has reserved the issue to prevent duplicate dispatch.
   - In practice, claimed issues are either `Running` or `RetryQueued`.

3. `Running`
   - Worker task exists and the issue is tracked in `running` map.

4. `RetryQueued`
   - Worker is not running, but a retry timer exists in `retry_attempts`.

5. `Released`
   - Claim removed because issue is terminal, non-active, missing, or retry path completed without
     re-dispatch.

Important nuance:

- A successful worker exit does not mean the issue is done forever.
- The worker may continue through multiple back-to-back coding-agent turns before it exits.
- After each normal turn completion, the worker re-checks the tracker issue state.
- If the issue is still in an active state, the worker should start another turn on the same live
  coding-agent thread in the same workspace, up to `agent.max_turns`.
- The first turn should use the full rendered task prompt.
- Continuation turns should send only continuation guidance to the existing thread, not resend the
  original task prompt that is already present in the session.
- Reconciliation or external tracker state changes may still stop the run between turns.

### 7.2 Active vs Terminal vs Other Tracker States

Tracker state categories are defined by config:

- `Active States`
  - Eligible for dispatch or continuation.
- `Terminal States`
  - Require workspace cleanup and run cancellation when reconciled.
- `Other States`
  - Not dispatchable; running work is stopped without cleanup when reconciled.

Normalization:

- Compare states case-insensitively after lowering both config values and issue state.

### 7.3 Dispatch Eligibility Rules

The orchestrator should dispatch an issue only if all of the following are true:

1. Issue is in an active state.
2. Issue is not already claimed (running or queued for retry).
3. Global concurrency has capacity.
4. If per-state concurrency override exists, that state also has capacity.
5. Workflow/config validation passes.
6. Required tracker credentials and config are present.
7. For `Todo` issues:
   - If blockers exist, all blockers must be in terminal states.
   - Otherwise issue is not eligible.
8. For non-`Todo` active issues:
   - Blockers do not prevent dispatch by default unless workflow policy says otherwise.

Dispatch ordering:

1. Lower numeric priority first (`1` before `2`, `null` last).
2. Older `created_at` first.
3. Stable fallback by identifier if needed.

### 7.4 Continuation Turns vs Continuation Retries

Two separate continuation mechanisms exist:

1. `In-worker continuation turn`
   - Happens immediately after a normal turn completion while the issue remains active and
     `turn_number < agent.max_turns`.
   - Reuses the same workspace and the same coding-agent thread.
   - Does not leave the `Running` state.

2. `Orchestrator continuation retry`
   - Happens after the worker exits normally.
   - Schedules a short retry timer (attempt 1) so the issue can be re-polled/re-dispatched if it
     still remains active.
   - Used as a simple re-entry point for long-running issues that may need more work beyond one
     worker lifetime.

This distinction matters because:

- `turn_number` is per worker lifetime.
- `attempt` is per orchestrator retry lifecycle.

### 7.5 Retry Scheduling Rules

Retry should be used for:

- Worker spawn failure
- Workspace creation/pre-run failure
- Coding-agent startup/turn failure
- Reconciliation-triggered termination if the implementation chooses to requeue
- Retry timer dispatch failure due to no capacity
- Continuation after a normal worker exit

Backoff rules:

- Continuation after normal exit:
  - Use a small fixed delay (example: 1000 ms).
  - Store as retry `attempt = 1`.
- Failure retry:
  - Exponential backoff starting at 10 seconds.
  - Formula example: `min(10_000 * 2^(attempt-1), max_retry_backoff_ms)`
- If config changes `max_retry_backoff_ms`, future scheduling uses the new cap.

Retry queue invariants:

- Only one retry timer per issue ID at a time.
- Retried issue remains claimed until explicitly released or re-dispatched.

### 7.6 Stop/Release Rules

Running session should be stopped when:

- Issue enters a terminal state
- Issue leaves active states for a non-terminal state
- Operator/runtime stop is requested
- Stall timeout fires

Release claim when:

- Retry timer fires and issue is no longer active/eligible
- Issue is terminal/missing during reconciliation
- Cleanup path finishes and the issue should no longer be retained in memory

Workspace cleanup should happen when:

- Issue is in terminal state at reconciliation
- Issue is in terminal state during startup cleanup sweep

Workspace cleanup should not happen when:

- Issue is simply moved to a non-active but non-terminal state
- Worker exits abnormally but the issue is still active and retryable

## 8. Orchestrator Runtime Behavior

### 8.1 Polling Loop

Behavior:

- Start a poll tick immediately on service startup after validation and startup cleanup.
- Schedule next tick using the current effective `polling.interval_ms`.
- Only one orchestrator loop should own scheduling state.

Per tick sequence:

1. Reconcile currently running issues against tracker state.
2. Re-validate workflow/config preconditions for dispatch.
3. Fetch candidate issues from tracker.
4. Sort issues for dispatch.
5. Dispatch as many as capacity allows.
6. Publish status snapshot/update to observers (if implemented).
7. Schedule the next tick.

Failure handling:

- Tracker fetch errors should log and skip dispatch for that tick.
- Validation errors should log and skip dispatch for that tick.
- Reconciliation failures should not crash the loop.

### 8.2 Startup Cleanup

On startup:

1. Load config/workflow.
2. Query tracker for issues already in terminal states (using configured `terminal_states`).
3. Remove any corresponding workspaces.

Properties:

- Best-effort: failure to clean one workspace should not crash startup.
- Safe when workspace root does not exist.

### 8.3 Concurrency Management

Global cap:

- Do not dispatch above `agent.max_concurrent_agents`.

Per-state cap:

- If `agent.max_concurrent_agents_by_state[state]` exists, also enforce that cap for issues in that
  normalized state.

Counting:

- Count only currently running worker entries.
- Retry-queued issues are claimed but do not consume active execution slots.

### 8.4 Reconciliation

Reconciliation runs each tick before dispatch:

1. If no running issues, return immediately.
2. Ask tracker for latest states of running issue IDs.
3. For each running issue:
   - If terminal -> stop worker and clean workspace.
   - Else if still active -> update cached issue state.
   - Else -> stop worker without cleanup.

If refresh fails:

- Keep workers running.
- Log the error.

### 8.5 Stall Detection

Stall detection is based on coding-agent event freshness.

Rules:

- If `codex.stall_timeout_ms <= 0`, disabled.
- A run is stalled if:
  - it is still marked running, and
  - it has a `last_codex_timestamp`, and
  - current monotonic/UTC time exceeds that timestamp by `stall_timeout_ms`
  - OR startup/turn-start has not completed within an implementation-defined reasonable window.

On stall:

- Stop the worker/coding-agent process.
- Schedule failure retry.
- Emit operator-visible log/status event.

## 9. Workspace Manager Specification

### 9.1 Workspace Path Derivation

Given:

- `workspace_root`
- `issue.identifier`

Compute:

- `workspace_key = sanitize(issue.identifier)`
- `workspace_path = join(workspace_root, workspace_key)`

Containment requirement:

- After expansion/resolution, `workspace_path` must remain under `workspace_root`.

### 9.2 Create / Ensure Workspace

Behavior:

- If workspace path does not exist:
  - create directory recursively
  - mark `created_now = true`
- If workspace path exists and is a directory:
  - reuse it
  - mark `created_now = false`
- If workspace path exists and is not a directory:
  - replace or fail per implementation policy, but never launch agent against a non-directory path

Cleanup before use:

- May remove implementation-specific temp artifacts from the workspace, such as:
  - `tmp`
  - `.elixir_ls`

### 9.3 Hook Execution Contract

Hooks run via shell in the workspace directory.

Shell semantics:

- Execute with `bash -lc "<script>"`.
- cwd must be the workspace path.

Timeout semantics:

- Kill hook process on timeout.
- `after_create` and `before_run` timeouts/failures abort current attempt.
- `after_run` and `before_remove` timeouts/failures are logged and ignored.

Suggested logging:

- Hook name
- workspace path
- exit code or timeout
- truncated stdout/stderr or combined output

### 9.4 Cleanup Behavior

On workspace removal:

1. If path exists and is a directory:
   - run `before_remove` best-effort
   - delete directory recursively
2. If path does not exist:
   - succeed as no-op

Best-effort means:

- errors are logged
- cleanup still continues where safe

## 10. Agent Runner and Prompt Construction

### 10.1 Prompt Rendering Inputs

Inputs to render:

- workflow prompt template
- normalized issue
- attempt number

Strictness:

- Unknown variables/filters are errors.

### 10.2 Turn Prompt Model

First turn:

- Render the full workflow prompt template with:
  - `issue`
  - `attempt = null` (or omitted according to template engine semantics)

Continuation turn (same worker lifetime):

- Do not resend the original rendered workflow prompt.
- Send a smaller continuation prompt that at minimum includes:
  - issue identifier
  - current tracker state
  - current turn number and `agent.max_turns`
  - explicit instruction to continue from current workspace state
- Implementations may include a concise summary of prior turn outcome if available.

Example continuation prompt concept:

```text
Continue working on issue ABC-123 from the current workspace state.
This is continuation turn 2 of 5 for the current worker run.
The issue is still in active state `In Progress`.
Do not repeat completed work; inspect the workspace and proceed.
```

### 10.3 Agent Run Lifecycle

Worker attempt sequence:

1. Ensure workspace exists.
2. Run `before_run` hook.
3. Start coding-agent app-server session.
4. Run first turn.
5. After each normal turn completion:
   - refresh issue state
   - if still active and under `max_turns`, run another continuation turn
6. Stop session.
7. Run `after_run` hook.
8. Exit:
   - `normal` on success/clean completion
   - abnormal on any error/timeout/startup failure

### 10.4 Run Outcome Classes

- `success/normal`
  - Worker finished cleanly.
  - Schedules short continuation retry so issue can be picked up again if still active.
- `configuration failure`
  - Prompt/template/hook setup issue.
  - Retry or release based on implementation policy; retry is acceptable if transient.
- `runtime failure`
  - Coding-agent startup/read/turn/stall failure.
  - Schedule exponential retry.
- `cancellation`
  - Reconciliation or operator-driven stop due to issue state change.
  - Usually release claim or requeue depending on new state.

## 11. Issue Tracker Integration Contract

This specification version defines the Linear adapter contract. Other tracker adapters can follow
the same normalized issue model and orchestration hooks.

## 11.1 Required Capabilities

Tracker integration must provide:

1. `fetch_candidate_issues(active_states)` -> list of normalized issues
2. `fetch_issues_by_states(states)` -> list of normalized issues
3. `fetch_issue_states_by_ids(ids)` -> list of minimal normalized issues

### 11.2 Linear Query Semantics

Candidate issues query:

- Filter by:
  - team project slug = configured `tracker.project_slug`
  - state name in `active_states`
- Include fields needed to build normalized issue model and blockers.
- Support pagination.

Refresh by IDs query:

- Query by internal IDs using GraphQL type `[ID!]`.
- Return minimal fields needed for reconciliation (`id`, `identifier`, `state`, optionally labels/url`).

Terminal fetch query:

- Filter by configured `terminal_states`.

### 11.3 Normalization Rules

Labels:

- Convert each label name to lowercase.

Blocked-by:

- Derive from inverse issue relations where relation type indicates the other issue blocks this one.

Priority:

- Preserve numeric value if present.

Null handling:

- Missing optional fields should become `null` or empty list as appropriate.

### 11.4 Error Handling Requirements

Map tracker failures into typed categories or consistent error payloads for logging, including:

- request transport failure
- non-200 HTTP response
- malformed JSON
- GraphQL errors
- invalid expected shape

## 12. Coding-Agent App-Server Client Specification

This section describes the expected behavior of the coding-agent subprocess wrapper. The exact wire
schema may evolve with the target coding-agent version, but a conforming implementation needs the
following behavioral contract.

### 12.1 Process Launch

Launch:

- cwd = workspace path
- command = `bash -lc <codex.command>`

Requirements:

- stdout and stderr are read separately.
- JSON protocol frames are newline-delimited on stdout.
- Partial lines must be buffered until newline.

### 12.2 Startup / Handshake Behavior

Required startup sequence (names illustrative):

1. Send `initialize`
2. Receive initialize result
3. Send `initialized`
4. Send `thread/start`
5. Receive `thread_id`
6. Send `turn/start`
7. Receive `turn_id`

Implementation must:

- extract `thread_id`
- extract `turn_id`
- emit `session_started` event to orchestrator
- build `session_id = "<thread_id>-<turn_id>"`

The exact JSON schema for `initialize`, `thread/start`, and `turn/start` depends on the targeted
coding-agent app-server protocol version, but the implementation must preserve the logical behavior
above and expose a compatibility surface documented for operators.

### 12.3 Event Handling

The client should interpret coding-agent messages into higher-level events, such as:

- `session_started`
- `message_delta`
- `tool_call_started`
- `tool_call_completed`
- `tool_call_failed`
- `approval_requested`
- `input_requested`
- `turn_completed`
- `turn_failed`
- `rate_limits`
- `usage`

Requirements:

- Unsupported events should not crash the client.
- Unsupported dynamic tool calls should fail fast and return an error payload to the session if
  client-side tool support is implemented.
- Unsupported or disallowed approval/input requests should be handled according to the runtime's
  documented policy instead of hanging forever.

### 12.4 Timeouts

Required timeouts:

- `read_timeout_ms`
  - for response/read inactivity during request/response phases
- `turn_timeout_ms`
  - hard cap for a turn
- `stall_timeout_ms`
  - monitored at orchestrator level using event freshness

### 12.5 Usage and Rate Limits

The client should collect, when present:

- input tokens
- output tokens
- total tokens
- any rate-limit snapshot information exposed by the coding agent

These should be reported to the orchestrator incrementally and aggregated into runtime totals.

### 12.6 Client-Side Dynamic Tool Extension (Optional)

This extension is optional for conformance but common in practice.

If implemented:

- The client advertises supported tools during startup/initialize according to the targeted
  app-server protocol.
- Supported tool calls should execute locally and respond back into the active session.
- Unsupported tool names should produce a failure response without hanging the session.

One common tool is `linear_graphql`, which allows the coding agent to query or mutate tracker data
using the runtime's configured Linear credentials.

If `linear_graphql` is implemented:

- input schema:
  - `query` (string, required)
  - `variables` (object, optional)
- execution:
  - send raw GraphQL request to configured Linear endpoint using resolved API key
- success/failure response:
  - wrap tool result into a session-compatible success/failure payload
  - if top-level GraphQL `errors` exist, return `success=false` while preserving the body
- malformed args or missing auth should return structured failure payloads, not crash the worker

## 13. Observability and Optional Status Surface

### 13.1 Structured Logging

At minimum log:

- issue lifecycle events
- worker start/stop
- retry scheduling
- workspace hook outcomes
- coding-agent session lifecycle
- validation failures

Recommended structured fields:

- `issue_id`
- `issue_identifier`
- `session_id`
- `worker_pid` or task id
- `retry_attempt`
- `workspace_path`
- `issue_state`
- `event`
- `error`

### 13.2 Aggregate Metrics (In-Memory is Acceptable)

Recommended aggregates:

- total running seconds across completed sessions
- total input tokens
- total output tokens
- total tokens
- latest rate-limit snapshot

### 13.3 Humanized Event Summaries (Optional)

An implementation may convert low-level agent events into human-readable summaries for operator
surfaces.

Example summaries:

- `thinking`
- `running tests`
- `writing file`
- `waiting for approval`

This is optional and should not change correctness.

### 13.4 Snapshot Interface (Optional)

An implementation may expose a read-only runtime snapshot API for operator visibility.

Possible snapshot content:

- running issue rows
- queued retry rows
- totals
- rate limits
- last events
- effective config values

### 13.5 Status Rendering (Optional)

An implementation may render:

- terminal dashboard
- HTTP JSON endpoint
- HTML page
- logs only

The rendering mechanism is not prescribed by this spec.

### 13.6 Failure Visibility

Minimum requirement:

- configuration validation failures must be operator-visible
- worker failures must be operator-visible
- reload failures must be operator-visible

### 13.7 Optional HTTP Server Extension

This section describes a common extension profile. It is not required for conformance, but if an
implementation ships an HTTP server, it should follow these baseline rules.

Config / startup:

- The server is enabled only when a port is configured via `server.port` in `WORKFLOW.md` or an
  equivalent CLI flag.
- If a CLI port override is present, it takes precedence over `server.port`.
- The bind host should default to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) unless the implementation explicitly
  documents a different choice.
- Binding to port `0` may be allowed for ephemeral local development; if so, the chosen port should
  be logged or otherwise surfaced.
- The HTTP server should not start if the configured port is invalid or unavailable; the
  implementation may fail startup or continue without the server, but it must do so explicitly and
  visibly.

Baseline endpoints:

- `GET /healthz`
  - Returns a simple success payload when the process is healthy enough to serve.
- `GET /status`
  - Returns a snapshot of running issues, retry queue, and selected runtime totals.
- `GET /logs`
  - Returns recent operator-relevant log lines or a pointer/summary if logs are file-backed.

Response semantics:

- `GET /healthz`
  - `200` with a small JSON or text body when healthy.
- `GET /status`
  - `200` with JSON snapshot on success.
  - `503` or `500` if the snapshot subsystem is unavailable and the implementation chooses not to
    degrade gracefully.
- `GET /logs`
  - `200` with plain text or JSON if logs are available.
  - `404` or `501` if log serving is not enabled.

Security / safety:

- Default bind host should avoid exposing the service publicly without deliberate operator action.
- If the server can expose issue metadata, prompts, or logs, implementations should document that
  behavior because it may contain sensitive data.
- If access control is not implemented, the server should be treated as a local-development /
  trusted-network feature.

Observability:

- Server start/stop and chosen bind address should be logged.
- Request logging should avoid leaking secrets or excessive prompt content.

## 14. CLI Contract

### 14.1 Startup Interface

Required CLI behavior:

- Accept optional positional workflow path.
- If absent, default to `./WORKFLOW.md`.
- Optionally accept additional implementation-specific flags (for example log level, HTTP port
  override).

Example:

```bash
symphony ./WORKFLOW.md
```

Or:

```bash
symphony
```

### 14.2 Exit Semantics

- Exit `0` when application starts and later shuts down normally.
- Exit non-zero when startup validation fails or the host process exits abnormally.

## 15. Security and Operational Safety

### 15.1 Trust Boundary Assumption

Each implementation defines its own trust boundary.

Operational safety requirements:

- Implementations should state clearly whether they are intended for trusted environments, more
  restrictive environments, or both.
- Implementations should state clearly whether they rely on auto-approved actions, operator
  approvals, stricter sandboxing, or some combination of those controls.
- Workspace isolation and path validation are important baseline controls, but they are not a
  substitute for whatever approval and sandbox policy an implementation chooses.

### 15.2 Filesystem Safety Requirements

Mandatory:

- Workspace path must remain under configured workspace root.
- Coding-agent cwd must be the per-issue workspace path for the current run.
- Workspace directory names must use sanitized identifiers.

Recommended additional hardening for ports:

- Run under a dedicated OS user.
- Restrict workspace root permissions.
- Mount workspace root on a dedicated volume if possible.

### 15.3 Secret Handling

- Support `$VAR` indirection in workflow config.
- Do not log API tokens or secret env values.
- Validate presence of secrets without printing them.

### 15.4 Hook Script Safety

Workspace hooks are arbitrary shell scripts from `WORKFLOW.md`.

Implications:

- Hooks are fully trusted configuration.
- Hooks run inside the workspace directory.
- Hook output should be truncated in logs.
- Hook timeouts are required to avoid hanging the orchestrator.

### 15.5 Harness Hardening Guidance

Running Codex agents against repositories, issue trackers, and other inputs that may contain
sensitive data or externally-controlled content can be dangerous. A permissive deployment can lead
to data leaks, destructive mutations, or full machine compromise if the agent is induced to execute
harmful commands or use overly-powerful integrations.

Implementations should explicitly evaluate their own risk profile and harden the execution harness
where appropriate. This specification intentionally does not mandate a single hardening posture, but
ports should not assume that tracker data, repository contents, prompt inputs, or tool arguments are
fully trustworthy just because they originate inside a normal workflow.

Possible hardening measures include:

- Tightening Codex approval and sandbox settings described elsewhere in this specification instead
  of running with a maximally permissive configuration.
- Adding external isolation layers such as OS/container/VM sandboxing, network restrictions, or
  separate credentials beyond the built-in Codex policy controls.
- Filtering which Linear issues, projects, teams, labels, or other tracker sources are eligible for
  dispatch so untrusted or out-of-scope tasks do not automatically reach the agent.
- Narrowing the optional `linear_graphql` tool so it can only read or mutate data inside the
  intended project scope, rather than exposing general workspace-wide tracker access.
- Reducing the set of client-side tools, credentials, filesystem paths, and network destinations
  available to the agent to the minimum needed for the workflow.

The correct controls are deployment-specific, but implementations should document them clearly and
treat harness hardening as part of the core safety model rather than an optional afterthought.

## 17. Test and Validation Matrix

A conforming implementation should include tests that cover the behaviors defined in this
specification.

Validation profiles:

- `Core Conformance`: deterministic tests required for all conforming implementations.
- `Extension Conformance`: required only for optional features that an implementation chooses to
  ship.
- `Real Integration Profile`: environment-dependent smoke/integration checks recommended before
  production use.

Unless otherwise noted, Sections 17.1 through 17.7 are `Core Conformance`. Bullets that begin with
`If ... is implemented` are `Extension Conformance`.

### 17.1 Workflow and Config Parsing

- Workflow file path precedence:
  - explicit runtime path is used when provided
  - cwd default is `WORKFLOW.md` when no explicit runtime path is provided
- Workflow file changes are detected and trigger re-read/re-apply without restart
- Invalid workflow reload keeps last known good effective configuration and emits an
  operator-visible error
- Missing `WORKFLOW.md` returns typed error
- Invalid YAML front matter returns typed error
- Front matter non-map returns typed error
- Config defaults apply when optional values are missing
- `tracker.kind` validation enforces currently supported kind (`linear`)
- `tracker.api_key` works (including `$VAR` indirection)
- `$VAR` resolution works for tracker API key and path values
- `~` path expansion works
- `codex.command` is preserved as a shell command string
- Per-state concurrency override map normalizes state names and ignores invalid values
- Prompt template renders `issue` and `attempt`
- Prompt rendering fails on unknown variables (strict mode)

### 17.2 Workspace Manager and Safety

- Deterministic workspace path per issue identifier
- Missing workspace directory is created
- Existing workspace directory is reused
- Existing non-directory path at workspace location is handled safely (replace or fail per
  implementation policy)
- Optional workspace population/synchronization errors are surfaced
- Temporary artifacts (`tmp`, `.elixir_ls`) are removed during prep
- `after_create` hook runs only on new workspace creation
- `before_run` hook runs before each attempt and failure/timeouts abort the current attempt
- `after_run` hook runs after each attempt and failure/timeouts are logged and ignored
- `before_remove` hook runs on cleanup and failures/timeouts are ignored
- Workspace path sanitization and root containment invariants are enforced before agent launch
- Agent launch uses the per-issue workspace path as cwd and rejects out-of-root paths

### 17.3 Issue Tracker Client

- Candidate issue fetch uses active states and project slug
- Linear query uses the specified project filter field (`slugId`)
- Empty `fetch_issues_by_states([])` returns empty without API call
- Pagination preserves order across multiple pages
- Blockers are normalized from inverse relations of type `blocks`
- Labels are normalized to lowercase
- Issue state refresh by ID returns minimal normalized issues
- Issue state refresh query uses GraphQL ID typing (`[ID!]`) as specified in Section 11.2
- Error mapping for request errors, non-200, GraphQL errors, malformed payloads

### 17.4 Orchestrator Dispatch, Reconciliation, and Retry

- Dispatch sort order is priority then oldest creation time
- `Todo` issue with non-terminal blockers is not eligible
- `Todo` issue with terminal blockers is eligible
- Active-state issue refresh updates running entry state
- Non-active state stops running agent without workspace cleanup
- Terminal state stops running agent and cleans workspace
- Reconciliation with no running issues is a no-op
- Normal worker exit schedules a short continuation retry (attempt 1)
- Abnormal worker exit increments retries with 10s-based exponential backoff
- Retry backoff cap uses configured `agent.max_retry_backoff_ms`
- Retry queue entries include attempt, due time, identifier, and error
- Stall detection kills stalled sessions and schedules retry
- Slot exhaustion requeues retries with explicit error reason
- If a snapshot API is implemented, it returns running rows, retry rows, token totals, and rate
  limits
- If a snapshot API is implemented, timeout/unavailable cases are surfaced

### 17.5 Coding-Agent App-Server Client

- Launch command uses workspace cwd and invokes `bash -lc <codex.command>`
- Startup handshake sends `initialize`, `initialized`, `thread/start`, `turn/start`
- `initialize` includes client identity/capabilities payload required by the targeted Codex
  app-server protocol
- Policy-related startup payloads use the implementation's documented approval/sandbox settings
- `thread/start` and `turn/start` parse nested IDs and emit `session_started`
- Request/response read timeout is enforced
- Turn timeout is enforced
- Partial JSON lines are buffered until newline
- Stdout and stderr are handled separately; protocol JSON is parsed from stdout only
- Non-JSON stderr lines are logged but do not crash parsing
- Command/file-change approvals are handled according to the implementation's documented policy
- Unsupported dynamic tool calls are rejected without stalling the session
- User input requests are handled according to the implementation's documented policy and do not
  stall indefinitely
- Usage and rate-limit payloads are extracted from nested payload shapes
- Compatible payload variants for approvals, user-input-required signals, and usage/rate-limit
  telemetry are accepted when they preserve the same logical meaning
- If optional client-side tools are implemented, the startup handshake advertises the supported tool
  specs required for discovery by the targeted app-server version
- If the optional `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension is implemented:
  - the tool is advertised to the session
  - valid `query` / `variables` inputs execute against configured Linear auth
  - top-level GraphQL `errors` produce `success=false` while preserving the GraphQL body
  - invalid arguments, missing auth, and transport failures return structured failure payloads
  - unsupported tool names still fail without stalling the session

### 17.6 Observability

- Validation failures are operator-visible
- Structured logging includes issue/session context fields
- Logging sink failures do not crash orchestration
- Token/rate-limit aggregation remains correct across repeated agent updates
- If a human-readable status surface is implemented, it is driven from orchestrator state and does
  not affect correctness
- If humanized event summaries are implemented, they cover key wrapper/agent event classes without
  changing orchestrator behavior

### 17.7 CLI and Host Lifecycle

- CLI accepts an optional positional workflow path argument (`path-to-WORKFLOW.md`)
- CLI uses `./WORKFLOW.md` when no workflow path argument is provided
- CLI errors on nonexistent explicit workflow path or missing default `./WORKFLOW.md`
- CLI surfaces startup failure cleanly
- CLI exits with success when application starts and shuts down normally
- CLI exits nonzero when startup fails or the host process exits abnormally

### 17.8 Real Integration Profile (Recommended)

These checks are recommended for production readiness and may be skipped in CI when credentials,
network access, or external service permissions are unavailable.

- A real tracker smoke test can be run with valid credentials supplied by `LINEAR_API_KEY` or a
  documented local bootstrap mechanism (for example `~/.linear_api_key`).
- Real integration tests should use isolated test identifiers/workspaces and clean up tracker
  artifacts when practical.
- A skipped real-integration test should be reported as skipped, not silently treated as passed.
- If a real-integration profile is explicitly enabled in CI or release validation, failures should
  fail that job.

## 18. Implementation Checklist (Definition of Done)

Use the same validation profiles as Section 17:

- Section 18.1 = `Core Conformance`
- Section 18.2 = `Extension Conformance`
- Section 18.3 = `Real Integration Profile`

### 18.1 Required for Conformance

- Workflow path selection supports explicit runtime path and cwd default
- `WORKFLOW.md` loader with YAML front matter + prompt body split
- Typed config layer with defaults and `$` resolution
- Dynamic `WORKFLOW.md` watch/reload/re-apply for config and prompt
- Polling orchestrator with single-authority mutable state
- Issue tracker client with candidate fetch + state refresh + terminal fetch
- Workspace manager with sanitized per-issue workspaces
- Workspace lifecycle hooks (`after_create`, `before_run`, `after_run`, `before_remove`)
- Hook timeout config (`hooks.timeout_ms`, default `60000`)
- Coding-agent app-server subprocess client with JSON line protocol
- Codex launch command config (`codex.command`, default `codex app-server`)
- Strict prompt rendering with `issue` and `attempt` variables
- Exponential retry queue with continuation retries after normal exit
- Configurable retry backoff cap (`agent.max_retry_backoff_ms`, default 5m)
- Reconciliation that stops runs on terminal/non-active tracker states
- Workspace cleanup for terminal issues (startup sweep + active transition)
- Structured logs with `issue_id`, `issue_identifier`, and `session_id`
- Operator-visible observability (structured logs; optional snapshot/status surface)

### 18.2 Recommended Extensions (Not Required for Conformance)

- Optional HTTP server honors CLI `--port` over `server.port`, uses a safe default bind host, and
  exposes the baseline endpoints/error semantics in Section 13.7 if shipped.
- Optional `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension exposes raw Linear GraphQL access through the
  app-server session using configured Symphony auth.
- TODO: Persist retry queue and session metadata across process restarts.
- TODO: Make observability settings configurable in workflow front matter without prescribing UI
  implementation details.
- TODO: Add first-class tracker write APIs (comments/state transitions) in the orchestrator instead
  of only via agent tools.
- TODO: Add pluggable issue tracker adapters beyond Linear.

### 18.3 Operational Validation Before Production (Recommended)

- Run the `Real Integration Profile` from Section 17.8 with valid credentials and network access.
- Verify hook execution and workflow path resolution on the target host OS/shell environment.
- If the optional HTTP server is shipped, verify the configured port behavior and loopback/default
  bind expectations on the target environment.

## Appendix A. SSH Worker Extension (Optional)

This appendix describes a common extension profile in which Symphony keeps one central
orchestrator but executes worker runs on one or more remote hosts over SSH.

### A.1 Execution Model

- The orchestrator remains the single source of truth for polling, claims, retries, and
  reconciliation.
- `worker.ssh_hosts` provides the candidate SSH destinations for remote execution.
- Each worker run is assigned to one host at a time, and that host becomes part of the run's
  effective execution identity along with the issue workspace.
- `workspace.root` is interpreted on the remote host, not on the orchestrator host.
- The coding-agent app-server is launched over SSH stdio instead of as a local subprocess, so the
  orchestrator still owns the session lifecycle even though commands execute remotely.
- Continuation turns inside one worker lifetime should stay on the same host and workspace.
- A remote host should satisfy the same basic contract as a local worker environment: reachable
  shell, writable workspace root, coding-agent executable, and any required auth or repository
  prerequisites.

### A.2 Scheduling Notes

- SSH hosts may be treated as a pool for dispatch.
- Implementations may prefer the previously used host on retries when that host is still
  available.
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` is an optional shared per-host cap across configured SSH
  hosts.
- When all SSH hosts are at capacity, dispatch should wait rather than silently falling back to a
  different execution mode.
- Implementations may fail over to another host when the original host is unavailable before work
  has meaningfully started.
- Once a run has already produced side effects, a transparent rerun on another host should be
  treated as a new attempt, not as invisible failover.

### A.3 Problems to Consider

- Remote environment drift:
  - Each host needs the expected shell environment, coding-agent executable, auth, and repository
    prerequisites.
- Workspace locality:
  - Workspaces are usually host-local, so moving an issue to a different host is typically a cold
    restart unless shared storage exists.
- Path and command safety:
  - Remote path resolution, shell quoting, and workspace-boundary checks matter more once execution
    crosses a machine boundary.
- Startup and failover semantics:
  - Implementations should distinguish host-connectivity/startup failures from in-workspace agent
    failures so the same ticket is not accidentally re-executed on multiple hosts.
- Host health and saturation:
  - A dead or overloaded host should reduce available capacity, not cause duplicate execution or an
    accidental fallback to local work.
- Cleanup and observability:
  - Operators need to know which host owns a run, where its workspace lives, and whether cleanup
    happened on the right machine.
